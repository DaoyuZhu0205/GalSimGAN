# Galaxy Image Synthesis and Simulation Using GANs and Deep Learning

## Overview

Simulating and synthesizing galaxy images is essential for advancing our understanding of astrophysical processes and enabling realistic testing of observational techniques. Traditional methods often rely on rigid parametric models, which struggle to capture the full diversity of galaxy morphologies, spectral variations, and spatial complexities.

This project introduces a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based framework** that leverages domain-specific astrophysical constraints to produce **high-resolution, photorealistic galaxy images**. Our approach integrates astrophysical priors, multi-wavelength data, and advanced generative techniques to ensure **physical accuracy and visual realism**.

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical Modeling**: Captures both **global structures** and **fine-grained features** of galaxies.
- **Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) Matching**: Ensures **wavelength consistency** for multi-band galaxy images.
- **Domain-Specific Augmentation Pipeline**: Simulates **varying redshifts and observational conditions**.
- **High-Resolution Image Generation**: Produces **photorealistic galaxies** that align with astrophysical constraints.
- **Applications**: Useful for **cosmological simulations, survey calibration, and rare galaxy synthesis**.

## Methodology

Our framework is based on a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** architecture, incorporating:

1. **Astrophysical Priors**: Domain knowledge is embedded into the model training process.
2. **Multi-Wavelength Data Processing**: Uses observational data from different bands to generate realistic galaxy images.
3. **GAN-Based Generation**: Trains a deep learning model to synthesize high-fidelity galaxy images.
4. **Redshift Simulation**: Augments data with **realistic transformations** to simulate various observational conditions.
